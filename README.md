# 🛒 Market Basket Analysis

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a popular technique used by retailers to identify associations between items in customer transactions. This project leverages association rule mining to uncover hidden patterns in transactional data, helping businesses make data-driven decisions about product placement, promotions, and cross-selling strategies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project applies **association rule mining** using the Apriori algorithm to analyze a retail dataset and discover frequently co-purchased items. The insights are visualized through intuitive graphs to support decision-making in sales and marketing.

## 📊 Features

- 📦 Transactional data preprocessing
- 🔍 Frequent Itemset Mining using Apriori algorithm
- 🔗 Generation of Association Rules
- 📈 Interactive Visualizations (Support, Confidence, Lift)
- 💡 Business insights from discovered rules

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data Manipulation
- **mlxtend** – Apriori & Association Rule Mining
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** – Data Visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis Environment

## 📈 Sample Insights

Here are some examples of insights discovered from the dataset:

- Customers who buy **bread** often buy **butter**.
- If **milk** and **diapers** are purchased, there's a high chance **beer** is also bought.
- Products **X** and **Y** have a strong lift value, suggesting bundling opportunities.

> These insights help with store layout planning, personalized marketing, and recommendation systems.

## 🧠 How it Works

1. **Load and Clean Data** – Load transaction data and convert it into a format suitable for analysis.
2. **Frequent Itemset Mining** – Use Apriori to find itemsets that meet a minimum support threshold.
3. **Generate Rules** – Derive association rules with metrics like confidence and lift.
4. **Visualize** – Present patterns through bar plots, network graphs, and heatmaps.

## 📚 Dataset

The project uses a transactional dataset (`transactions.csv`). Replace this with your dataset or use publicly available datasets such as:

* [Online Retail Dataset - UCI ML Repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)

---

## 📈 Visualizations

Some key visualizations included:

* Support/Confidence bar charts
* Lift matrix heatmap
* Network graph of associations

---

## ✅ To-Do

* [ ] Add more advanced algorithms like FP-Growth
* [ ] Enable web-based dashboard (Streamlit/Flask)
* [ ] Allow user-uploaded datasets for custom analysis
